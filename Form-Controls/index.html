        2. What is the customer's email? I must make sure the email is valid. Email addresses have a consistent pattern.
        3. What colour should this t-shirt be? I must give 3 options. How will I make sure they don't pick other colours?
        4. What size does the customer want? I must give the following 6 options: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL -->
