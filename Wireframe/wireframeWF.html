            <h2>Now what are wireframes?</h2>
            <p>
                A wireframe is like a blueprint for a website or app. It's a super simple sketch that shows what goes
                where, like buttons, text, images, and menus, without any fancy colors or design elements. Think of it
                like drawing out your dream treehouse with just lines and labels before you actually build it. It helps
                people figure out how things will be laid out and how users will move around the site or app.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wireframes are used by designers, developers, and product teams to plan things before writing any code
                or adding visual details. It saves time and helps everyone agree on how things should work before
                building starts. Whether youâ€™re designing an app for school or planning the next big social platform,
                wireframes keep the vision clear and help avoid confusion later.
