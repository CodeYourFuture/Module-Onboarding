1. What is the purpose of a README file?
   A README file provides essential information about a project, including what it does, how to install and use it, dependencies, and how to contribute. It's often the first thing users or developers see when they visit your repository, and it helps them understand and get started quickly.

2. What is the purpose of a wireframe?
   A wireframe is a visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a web page or app before it's developed. It focuses on functionality and placement of elements (like buttons, menus, and content areas), helping teams plan and agree on the design before writing any code.

3. What is a branch in Git?
   A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase (usually the main or master branch). Once changes are complete, a branch can be merged back into the main project.
