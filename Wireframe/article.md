README File

A README file serves as the front page of a software project. It usually includes an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any necessary dependencies. This file helps users and contributors understand what the project is about and how to interact with it effectively.

Wireframe

A wireframe is a basic visual representation of a web page or app interface, outlining the layout, structure, and key elements without design details. It's used in the early stages of development to plan and communicate how the interface will function and flow.

Git Branch

A branch in Git allows developers to diverge from the main codebase to work on features, fixes, or experiments independently. This makes it easy to manage changes, collaborate without conflicts, and merge completed work back into the main project safely.
