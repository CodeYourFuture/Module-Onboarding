      <h1>What is the purpose of a README file?</h1>
      <p>About READMEs
You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.</p>
      <h1>What is the purpose of a wireframe?
</h1>
      <p>That's why wireframes exist. Wireframes are your blueprint: a simple, visual guide to quickly lay out your ideas and show how everything fits together. Before diving into colors, images, or final design details, wireframes help you map structure and functionality so nothing feels out of place.</p>
      <h1>What is a branch in Git?</h1>
      <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
