      <h2>README.md</h2>
      <p>
        A README file serves as a crucial introductory document for a project, providing essential information about its
        purpose, functionality, installation, usage, and other relevant details to users, collaborators, and
        maintainers.

      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframing is fancy way of saying "rough sketching" üé®‚úèÔ∏è. The objective is not to have a pixel-perfect
        rendering of the idea but rather to draw the minimum necessary to communicate. A wireframe should be as simple
        as possible to convey the concept to the observer without clutter or confusion.

      <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
      <p>
        The main idea behind the Git flow branching strategy is to isolate your work into different types of branches.
        There are different branch types.
