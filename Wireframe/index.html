        <h2>The Purpose of a README File</h2>
        <p>
          In software development, clear communication is essential. Whether you're working solo or with a team, it's important to effectively convey the purpose, setup, and usage of your project. This is where the README.md file comes in. In this article, we explore what a README.md file is and why it matters.

        <h2>What is a Wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          An essential step in user experience (UX) design is creating a wireframe. Itâ€™s a visual blueprint of a website, app, or digital interface, focusing on structure and layout without styling. Wireframes show what interface elements appear on key pages, helping plan content and navigation effectively.

        <h2>What is a Git Branch?</h2>
        <p>
          A Git branch represents a separate line of development in a codebase. By default, projects start with a "main" branch. Creating a branch allows developers to work on changes without affecting the main version. It's like a sandbox for experiments, while the main branch holds the stable production code.
