        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of a README file is to provide essential information about a project, software, code, or game to users and contributors. 
          It serves as the first point of contact, offering a concise and informative overview of the project's purpose, functionality, and usage.

      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of a wireframe is to provide a basic blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or app's user interface (UI). 
        It's like a rough sketch that focuses on the layout and placement of key elements rather than visual details.

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>
        In Git, a branch is essentially a separate line of development within your project's history. 
        Think of it as a parallel path where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase
