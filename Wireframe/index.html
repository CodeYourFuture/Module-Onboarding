      This is a wireframe for a simple web page. It includes a header, main
      content area with articles, and a footer. The articles contain
      placeholders for images and text, and links to read more.

      <h2>1. What is a branch in Git?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the
        main project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.

      <h2>2. What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. Wireframes provide a clear overview of
        the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. Styling,
        color, graphics, and other design elements are kept to a minimum.

      <h2>3. What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do
        with your project, and how they can use it.
