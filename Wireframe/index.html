      A wireframe is a visual representation of a webpage, app, or software interface. It is a critical tool in
      the design process that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a product before detailed design and
      development begin.

            The purpose of a wireframe is to visually outline the structure, layout, and functionality of a webpage, app, or
            software interface, focusing on usability and user flow without the distraction of detailed design elements.

            installation instructions, usage, and any other relevant details, helping users and developers understand and interact
            with the project effectively.

          <summary>Definition of a Branch</summary>
          <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate workspace for your project that allows you to isolate your work, such as
          developing a new feature or fixing a bug, from the main version of your project (often referred to as the main or master
          branch).
