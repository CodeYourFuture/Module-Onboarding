      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>A README file serves as an essential guide for a project, providing important information to users and contributors. It typically includes an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contributor details. Developers use README files to explain the purpose of their project, making it easier for others to understand and use. In open-source projects, a well-written README helps attract contributors by providing clear documentation. It also often includes links to additional resources, such as documentation, issue tracking, and licensing information. README files improve collaboration by ensuring that team members have a shared understanding of the project’s structure and goals. Overall, a README file enhances accessibility, usability, and maintainability of a project.</p>

      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>A wireframe is a visual blueprint of a webpage or application layout, outlining its structure and key elements. It helps designers and developers plan the interface before adding colors, graphics, or interactive features. Wireframes focus on usability, ensuring a smooth user experience by organizing content logically. They also serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders, aligning everyone’s vision. Overall, wireframes save time and effort by identifying potential design issues early in the development process.</p>

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>A Git branch is a parallel version of a repository that allows developers to work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. Each branch represents an isolated environment where changes can be made, tested, and refined. Once the work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch (usually called "main" or "master"), integrating the new changes into the overall project. This branching strategy enhances collaboration and helps manage the development process efficiently.</p>
