      <p>
       The wireframe also creates the layout of mobile app, or digital product's structure, focusing on user experience and
         functionality beforedetailed design and development. Wireframes act as a skeletal framework,
          it shows the relationships of key elements like text, buttons, images, and menus,
           without the distractions of color, graphics, or content. They help designers visualize the user
            interface, identify potential usability issues, and align on the project's direction early on.

        <h2>Git branch</h2>
        <p>
          What is branch in Git? A branch is used for new features and fixing bugs. 
          It gives you the chance to make changes to the code without impacting the main codebase.
           Once the work is completed, you can merge the changes into the application by merging the branch back into the main codebase.
