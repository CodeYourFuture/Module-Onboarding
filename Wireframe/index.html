            <h2>Wireframe Modelling of Web Based Open Data Applications</h2>
            <p>The paper explained an essential part of modern software development process is wireframe modeling. For such purpose, it is a crucial step in the design phase, requiring specialized tools. This paper introduces a model for the wireframe modelling, with special focus on understanding the process of wireframing. In order to achieve this, we shortly describe some of the software tools are described, along with description of the various methods and techniques used in wireframe modeling. Moreover, a model is presented for simplification of the process of wireframing. Additionally, a use case of the developed model for wireframe modelling is provided, illustrating how an open data-based web application for cultural institutions can be developed. In the final section of the paper, the work on this topic is concluded, along with recommendations for future work in this area.</p>

                <h3>What is the Purpose of a README File?</h3>
                <p>The README file explains what a project is, how to install and use it, and how to contribute. It serves as the main introduction and guide for anyone viewing the project.</p>

                <h3>What is a Branch in Git?</h3>
                <p>A Git branch allows developers to work on new features or fixes separately from the main code, ensuring that the main project stays stable. Once the work is ready, the branch can be merged back into the main codebase.</p>
