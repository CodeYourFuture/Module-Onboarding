      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README file serves as an introductory document for a project, providing essential information to
        users and contributors about the project, its purpose, how to use it, and how to get help.It's typically
        the first file a user will encounter when exploring a repository or software project, offering a concise
        overview and instructions.

      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe ?</h2>
      <p>The primary purpose of a wireframe is to establish the basic structure and layout of a website or application
        before visual design and content are added. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the placement of elements like
        headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders
        visualize the user experience and identify potential issues early in the project</P>

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>
        A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git
        is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
        Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. Note.
