          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>If you've ever lost a file or overwritten something important, Git is like a digital time machine that helps you avoid that chaos. It keeps track of your files as they change, letting you jump back to previous versions and understand who changed what and when. Pretty much a must-have if you’re working on projects — solo or with a team.</p>

          <h2>Why Do Developers Use Git?</h2>
          <p>Git makes working on code feel a lot less scary. You can experiment freely, knowing you can always roll back. But it’s not just about safety — it also makes collaboration smooth, since multiple people can work on the same project without constantly tripping over each other. No more saving files as 'final_FINAL_thisone_use.js'.</p>

          <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>Branches let you test out ideas or features in a safe space. You can mess around, experiment, or fix bugs without touching your main code. When it’s ready, you just merge it back in. If it’s not, toss it. It’s like having a sandbox for code — no pressure, no mess.</p>
