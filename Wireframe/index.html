        <h2>README File</h2>
        <p>
          A README file provides important information about a project. It
          typically includes details on what the project does, how to install
          and use it, and any other necessary instructions or guidelines. It's
          meant to help users and developers understand the purpose and
          functionality of the project quickly.

        <h2>Purpose of Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic visual guide that outlines the structure and
          layout of a webpage or app. Its purpose is to show where key elements
          like headers, buttons, images, and text will go without focusing on
          design details like colors or fonts. It helps designers, developers,
          and stakeholders plan and communicate ideas clearly before creating
          the final product.

        <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch is a separate workspace in a project that lets you work on
          changes or new features without affecting the main code. It points to
          a specific part of the project's history and allows you to experiment
          or fix bugs. Once done, you can merge it back into the main branch.
          Branches are lightweight, fast, and enable team members to work
          simultaneously on different tasks. Commands like git branch, git
          switch, and git merge make managing branches easy.
