        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          The wireframe also creates the layout of mobile app, or digital
          product's structure, focusing on user experience and functionality
          beforedetailed design and development. Wireframes act as a skeletal
          framework, it shows the relationships of key elements like text,
          buttons, images, and menus, without the distractions of color,
          graphics, or content. They help designers visualize the user
          interface, identify potential usability issues, and align on the
          project's direction early on.

          README Files are the contents and structure of a folder and/or a
          dataset it is used so that a researcher can locate the information
          they need. The README file provides essential information about the
          project, including its purpose, usage instructions, installation
          details, and how to contribute to it. It serves as the introduction to
          the project, as it help users understand what it does and how to get
          started. The README file is the first option a visitor will browse
          through when visiting your repository.

        <h2>Git branch</h2>

        <p>
          What is branch in Git? A branch is used for new features and fixing
          bugs. It gives you the chance to make changes to the code without
          impacting the main codebase. Once the work is completed, you can merge
          the changes into the application by merging the branch back into the
          main codebase. This helps teams collaborate, experiment safely, and
          keep the project organized.
          <br />
          Branching is a powerful part of version control. It encourages better
          code management, testing, and collaboration.
