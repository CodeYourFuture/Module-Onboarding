      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
      A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout.<br>
      You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project.<br>
          A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project.<br> 
          Think of it as the foundation for your website, app, or dashboard. It focuses on layout, and content placementâ€”not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.

        <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master <br>
           As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.</p>
