        <h2> What is the purpose of a wireframe?
</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project. 
          Think of it as the foundation for your website, app, or dashboard.
           It focuses on layout, and content placementâ€”not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.

        <h2> What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and 
          try new ideas without affecting the main project. 
          Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.</p>
