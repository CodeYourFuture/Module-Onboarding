    This is a template webpage for the first sprint of the onboarding module backlog.<br> It contains three articles exploring fundemental development concepts: the purpose of README files in the documentation, why are wireframes useful in the design process, and how git branches function in version control systems.<br>All of which are considered fundemental knowledge for web developement and collaborative project workflows.

          Branching in Git is a powerful feature that allows developers to diverge from the main codebase and work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. By creating a separate branch, you can make changes without affecting the stable version of your project, enabling parallel development and smoother collaboration among team members. This article explores how branching works in Git, why it's essential in modern version control workflows, and how to effectively use branches to manage your code with confidence and flexibility.

          README files are the cornerstone of good project documentation, offering a clear and concise introduction to a codebase or repository. Typically placed at the root of a project, a README serves as the first point of contact for users and contributors, outlining the project's purpose, installation steps, usage instructions, and other essential information. In this article, we'll explore the role of README files in software documentation, what makes an effective README, and how to craft one that improves user experience and encourages community engagement.

    <h3>Purpose of wireframes</h3>

          Wireframes are a foundational tool in the design process, serving as visual blueprints that outline the structure and layout of a digital product before any detailed design or development begins. By focusing on functionality, content placement, and user flow—without the distraction of colors or final graphics—wireframes help teams align on the user experience early on. In this article, we’ll examine the purpose of wireframes, how they facilitate collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders, and why they are essential for building intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
