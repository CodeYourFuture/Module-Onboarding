      <h1> What is the purpose of a README file?</h1>
      <p>
        A README file is a simple guide that explains what a project is,<br>
        how to set it up, how to use it, and other helpful details for anyone working with it.<br>
        It is usually the first file a user sees when they open a project,<br>
        and acts as a guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.<br>
