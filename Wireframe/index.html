      <h1>Beginners Guide: README File, Wireframe & Git Branch</h1>
      <p>
        This guide introduces beginners to three essential tools in any development project: the README file, wireframes, and Git branches. Learn how each one plays a vital role in planning, collaboration, and version control as you build your first project.

        <h2>The purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the first point of reference for anyone interacting with a project, providing essential information such as its purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Typically written in Markdown (README.md), it helps users understand what the project does, how to install dependencies, and how to contribute. It may also include licensing information, credits, and troubleshooting tips. A well-written README enhances a project's accessibility, making it easier for developers, collaborators, and even end users to navigate and understand the codebase.

        <h2>The purpose of a Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual blueprint that outlines the structure and layout of a digital interface, such as a website or mobile application. It is typically a low-fidelity representation that focuses on functionality, content placement, and user flow rather than aesthetics. Designers and developers use wireframes to plan interactions, ensure usability, and gather feedback early in the development process. By providing a clear visual guide, wireframes help teams align on design expectations, reduce development time, and create a user-friendly experience before moving on to high-fidelity prototypes and final designs.

        <h2> What is a branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is an independent version of a repository that allows multiple developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branching enables parallel development, meaning teams can work on new features while maintaining a stable production version. The most common branch in a project is main or master, but additional branches can be created for specific tasks, such as feature-login or bugfix-header. Developers can later merge these branches back into the main branch after code review and testing. This workflow ensures a smooth, organized, and collaborative development process.
