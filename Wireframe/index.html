        <h2>What is the purpose of a Wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a wireframe is to establish the basic structure and functionality of a website, app, or other
          digital product before diving into visual design and content. It serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework,
          visualizing how elements will be arranged and how users will navigate the interface.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the main
          project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.
