        This is a webpage explaining what is the purpose of a README file, what is the purpose of a wireframe,
        and what is a branch in Git.<br>
        There will be three articles below for that purpose.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is added to a repository to communicate important information about your project. 
          A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, 
          communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual guide to what a product should look like. 
          Its main goal is to create an app or site that delivers a cohesive and well-designed experience. 
          It is also a great way to ensure that every element in a UI has a purpose.

        <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is a pointer to a specific commit, effectively creating a parallel development line within your repository. 
          It allows developers to work on new features, fix bugs, or experiment with code changes without directly altering the main codebase.
