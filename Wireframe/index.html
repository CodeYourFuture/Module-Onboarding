        <h2><b>What is the purpose of WIREFRAME?</b></h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic, black and white blueprint of a website or app. It shows the layout of key elements like content blocks, navigation, and buttons, focusing on structure and functionality before visual design. Think of it as the skeleton of the interface, used for early planning, communication, and usability testing. It helps ensure a user-friendly design by prioritizing how users will interact with the product.

        <h2><b>What is the purpose of GIT?</b></h2>
        <p>
         Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It's primarily used for managing source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. Think of it as a sophisticated "undo" button and a powerful tool for managing different versions of your work. </p>
