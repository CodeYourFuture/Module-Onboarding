      <h1> What is the purpose of a README file?</h1>
      <p>
        A README file is a simple guide that explains what a project is,<br>
        how to set it up, how to use it, and other helpful details for anyone working with it.<br>
        It is usually the first file a user sees when they open a project,<br>
        and acts as a guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.<br>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a simple layout of an app or website that shows the structure and key features.<br>
          It's used early in design to plan how users will interact with the page before adding visuals and content.<br>
          Wireframes help designers and developers agree on the layout and functionality of a project.<br>
          The three main purposes of wireframes are: 
          <ol>
            <li>To keep the design focused on the user.</li>
            <li>To Help identify potential problems early in the design process by making features and navigation clear.</li>
            <li>A low-cost way to test ideas because they are quick to create.</li>
          </ol>
