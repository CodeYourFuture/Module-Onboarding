        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
            The article defines a wireframe as a basic two-dimensional layout of a web page or app interface. 
            It's used early in the design process to visualize the structure, layout, and functionality of a product without focusing on colors, graphics, or final design elements. 
            Wireframes help teams align on user flow, content placement, and feature priority, making them an essential communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders. 
            Typically created in grayscale, they serve as the foundation for further UI and UX development.
