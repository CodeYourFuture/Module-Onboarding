        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important
          information about your project. A README, along with a repository
          license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of
          conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you
          manage contributions.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural
          level. A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and
          functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user
          journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to
          establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and
          content is added.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
          Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without
          impacting the main branch. When the work is complete, a branch can be
          merged with the main project. You can even switch between branches and
          work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
          Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!
