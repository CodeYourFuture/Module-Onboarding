      <h1> Structuring Projects: README, Wireframes & Git</h1>
      <p>
        "This wireframe outlines the essential components of a well-structured development workflow, 
        covering README files, wireframing, and Git. A clear and informative README file helps developers 
        and contributors understand a project’s purpose, setup, and usage. Wireframing plays a crucial role
         in planning and visualizing user interfaces before coding begins, ensuring a smooth design process. 
         Git, as a version control system, enables efficient collaboration, tracking changes, and managing code repositories. 
         Together, these elements form the foundation of an organized and maintainable software development project

        <h3>wireframe </h3>
        <p>A wireframe is a simple visual representation of a webpage, app, or software interface, outlining
          its structure and layout without detailed design elements. It serves as a blueprint, showing where
          key components like buttons, images, and text will be placed.
          Wireframes are usually created in black-and-white or grayscale and focus on functionality rather
          than aesthetics. They help designers, developers, and stakeholders plan the user experience (UX)
          before moving on to full design and development.
          Common tools for creating wireframes include Figma, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, and Sketch

        <h3> Git </h3>
        <p>
          Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate
          efficiently, and manage project history. It allows multiple people to work on the same project
          without overwriting each other’s work.

          Key Features of Git:
Version Control – Tracks changes and allows reverting to previous versions.
Branching & Merging – Developers can work on separate branches and merge changes when ready.
 Collaboration – Teams can contribute without conflicts using platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
 Distributed System – Every developer has a full copy of the project history.

Basic Git Commands:
git init – Initializes a Git repository.
git add . – Stages changes for commit.
git commit -m "Message" – Saves changes with a message.
git push – Uploads changes to a remote repository.
git pull – Retrieves the latest changes from a remote repo.
Git is widely used in software development to ensure code safety, collaboration, and efficient
project management.
