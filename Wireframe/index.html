        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
        A wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. 
        Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, 
        and intended behaviors. Styling, color, graphics, and other design elements are kept to a minimum

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
        A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.
        The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last
        commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
