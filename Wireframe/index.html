        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is basically a quick guide to your project. It&#39;s
          usually the first thing people see when they visit your repository or
          open your folder. The main point of it is to explain what your project
          is about, how to use it, and anything important someone should know if
          they want to try it or help work on it.
        </p>
        <h3>It might include things like:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>What the project does</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How to set it up or install it</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Any special instructions or requirements</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Who made it or how to contact the creator</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A license or permission for how others can use it</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So in short, a README is there to make your project easy to understand
          and use—for both users and developers.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is basically a simple visual plan of a website or app. It
          shows where things like buttons, text, images, and menus will go—kind
          of like a rough draft before you start designing or building
          anything.<br />
          The main point of a wireframe is to figure out the layout and how
          users will move through the site. It helps everyone involved
          (designers, developers, clients) get on the same page about the
          structure and flow before putting in a lot of time and effort.<br />
          Think of it like sketching a floor plan before building a house—it's
          not about the colors or decoration yet, just where everything should
          be.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is like a separate copy of your project where you can
          safely make changes without messing up the main version.<br />
          Let&#39;s say you're adding a new feature or fixing something—rather
          than changing the main code right away, you create a branch, do your
          work there, and once you're happy with it, you can merge it back into
          the main project.<br />
          It helps keep things clear and makes it easier for teams to work on
          different things at the same time without getting in each other&#39;s
          way.<br />
          There are some provided HTML and CSS files you can use to get started.
          You can use these files as a starting point or create your own files
          from scratch.
