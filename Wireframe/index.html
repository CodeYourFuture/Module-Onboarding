      <p>
      A wireframe is a visual representation of a webpage, app, or software interface. It is a critical tool in
      the design process that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a product before detailed design and
      development begin.

          <p>
            A wireframe is a visual representation or blueprint of a webpage, app, or software interface. It is a critical tool in

          <p>
            A branch in Git is a separate workspace for your project that allows you to isolate your work, such as
            developing a new feature or fixing a bug, from the main version of your project (often referred to as the main or
            master
            branch).
