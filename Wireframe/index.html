        <h2>Explaining a Branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time. It is essentially a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. When you create a new branch, git creates a pointer that can move independently on that branch. As you make commits on that branch, the pointer advances forward with each commit.
          pointer advances forward with each commit.
