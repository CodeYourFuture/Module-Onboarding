          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal 
            framework of a website or application, focusing on layout 
            and functionality rather than design elements. 
            It serves as a blueprint for developers and designers to 
            understand the structure and flow of the project.

          <h2>README File</h2>
          <p>
            A README file contains information about what a project is, 
            how to set it up, and how to use it. 
            It helps others quickly grasp the purpose and structure of your work. 
            It typically includes installation instructions.

          <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
          <p>
            A branch in Git is a separate line of development that 
            allows multiple developers to work on different features 
            or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
