      <h2>README file</h2>
      <p>
        It provides crucial information about the project's purpose, functionality, and how to use it. Whether you're
        collaborating with a team or sharing your code with the world, having clear and concise documentation in your
        README can save countless hours of confusion and frustration

      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a simple, visual blueprint of a website or app, showing the layout of content and features
        without detailed design elements like colors or images. It focuses on structure and functionality, helping
        everyone understand the product layout and user flow.

      <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
      <p>
        A branch in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. The default branch is <code>main</code> or
        <code>master</code>. As you make commits, the branch pointer advances, allowing you to work on features in
        isolation before merging.
