        <h2>What is the Purpose of a README File?</h2>
        <p>A README file is a text file that provides essential information about a project.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.</li>
          <li>It's the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.</li>
          <li>The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from a bad one.</li>
          <li>Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!</li>
        </ol>

         <article class="Wireframe">
        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is a simplified visual representation of a website or application, focusing on the structure, layout, and functionality rather than visual aesthetics. It's essentially a blueprint for the user interface, helping designers and developers plan the flow and organization of content before diving into visual design.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Clarity and Communication:</strong> Wireframes give you clarity about how your project will look, it help you in visualizing the layout and functionality. This will also help you to have clear communication with the team members, clients, and developers.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> When you create a simple design for your project, it becomes easier to make changes before starting the actual work. This will save you time and also prevent expensive rework.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Wireframes usually focus on user experience as it helps to create layout, navigation, and content placement. This user-centered approach helps in creating interfaces that are user-friendly.</li>
        </ol>

      <article class="git">
        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Isolated Development:</strong> You can work on different features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main project or other team membersâ€™ work.</li>
          <li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Multiple developers or teams can work on different tasks at the same time without interfering with each other.</li>
          <li><strong>Safe Experimentation:</strong> Branches allow you to experiment with new features or changes without worrying about breaking the main codebase.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Collaboration:</strong> Multiple people can work on different parts of the project and later merge their work without conflicts.</li>
