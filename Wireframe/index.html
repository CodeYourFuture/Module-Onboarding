      <h1>One of the essential start-points for developers beginners</h1>
      <p>
        This webpage is for enthusiastic developers who are just starting their journey in web development. We often start with an idea for a website or application and aim to build it from scratch, but how do we create a plan for our project? One important step is to create a wireframe that outlines the structure and layout. Another approach is to use a ready-made template available on GitHub. However, it is important to understand its purpose and how it works by reviewing the included to repo README file. To effectively build a project, we usually need a team that can work collaboratively and productively. This is where branching comes in handy — it allows multiple team members to work on different features or fixes without interfering with each other’s code. So, let’s take a closer look at these aspects.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          README file is a first point of documentation on your project or repo on GitHub.
          It include instructions or links to instructions. README file is a text file with extention md.
          It is typically the first file that users and developers encounter when they access a project.
          It explains what the project is, how to set it up, and how to use it. This is crucial for effective collaboration and user engagement.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframe is a blueprint for your digital project. It helps plan and visualise the sceleton of your app or website before runing actual design.
          It shows how elements relate to each other and how they’re structured.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Branching on the Git means simply create a new or separate version of the main repository.
          Branches allow to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas.
