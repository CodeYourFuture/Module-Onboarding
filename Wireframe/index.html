        <h2>Readme File</h2>
        <p>
      A README file is a text file that provides essential information about a project, repository, or software.
      It serves as a guide for users and developers, helping them understand what the project does,
      how to use it, and how to contribute towards it.

        <h2> WireFrame</h2>
        <p>
        Wireframes are visual guides that outline the basic structure of a webpage or application. 
        They act as blueprints for a design, focusing on layout, functionality, and user flow rather than 
        aesthetics. </p>

        <h2>Branches in Git</h2>
        <p>Branches in Git are independent lines of development that allow developers to work on 
          different features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. 
          They enable collaboration and version control by keeping changes isolated until they are ready 
          to be merged.
