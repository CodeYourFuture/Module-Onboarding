      <h2>Electric vehicle</h2>

        An electric vehicle (EV) is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity.[1] EVs
        encompass a wide range of transportation modes, including road and rail vehicles, electric boats and

      <h2>Solar System</h2>
      <p>
        The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[11] It formed
        about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a
        protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen
        into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type
        main-sequence star.

      <h2>Blossom</h2>
      <p>
        In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus Prunus) and of some other plants with a similar
        appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

        Colloquially, flowers of orange are referred to as such as well. Peach blossoms (including nectarine), most
        cherry blossoms, and some almond blossoms are usually pink. Plum blossoms, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, some
        cherry blossoms, and most almond blossoms are white.[1]
