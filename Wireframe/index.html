      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
        A wireframe in coding (especially web or app development) is a simple visual layout or blueprint
         that shows the basic structure of a user interface (UI) without detailed design or content.

        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>
           Provide a clear and concise description of all relevant details about data collection, processing, and analysis in a README file. This will help others interpret and reanalyze your dataset.

          README files are created for a variety of reasons:
          
          to document changes to files or file names within a folder
          to explain file naming conventions, practices, etc. "in general" for future reference
          to specifically accompany files/data being deposited in a repository
           
          It is best practice to create a README file for each dataset regardless of whether it is being deposited in a repository because the document might become necessary later.

        <h2>Purpose of a wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          In simple terms, wireframes are visual representations of a web page or app interface, 
          stripped down to its bare bones. Think of it as the architectural blueprint of your design
          project. They outline the structure and functionality of your product without getting
          caught up in colors, visuals, or specific content.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
          Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
