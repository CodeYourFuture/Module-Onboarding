      <p>
      A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout.<br>
      You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project.<br>
          A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.
