        <h2>README</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the introductory document for a project, providing essential information to help users understand, install, and use the software or codebase. It typically outlines the project's purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies or requirements. The README helps streamline collaboration and onboarding by offering a clear overview and guidance to developers, users, or contributors.
          <ol>
          <li>Introduces the project and explains its purpose. 
          <li>Provides installation, usage, and setup instructions.
          <li>Helps new users or contributors understand how to get started.
          </ol>

        <h2>wireframe</h2>
        <p>
         A wireframe is a visual blueprint or schematic used in the early stages of designing a website or application.
         It outlines the basic structure and layout of a page, focusing on content placement, user interface elements, 
         and functionality without involving design details like colors or images. Wireframes help stakeholders, designers, 
         and developers align on functionality and user experience before investing in full design or development
        <ol>
          <li>Shows the layout and structure of a page or screen.
          <li> Helps plan functionality and user interactions.
          <li>Facilitates early feedback and alignment before detailed design.
        </ol>

        <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git allows developers to work on different versions or features of a project simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
          By creating a branch, you can isolate changes, experiment freely, and collaborate with others before merging the updates into the main branch.
          This helps manage development workflows, avoid conflicts, and maintain a stable production environment.

        <ol>
          <li>Enables isolated development of features or fixes.
          <li>Prevents disruptions to the main codebase.
          <li>Supports collaboration and smoother code integration.
        </ol>
