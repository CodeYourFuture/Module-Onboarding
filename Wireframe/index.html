      <h1>One of the essential start-points for developer beginners.</h1>
      <p>
        This webpage is for enthusiastic developers who are just starting their journey in web development. We often start with an idea for a website or application and aim to build it from scratch, but how do we create a plan for our project? One important step is to create a wireframe that outlines the structure and layout. Another approach is to use a ready-made template available on GitHub. However, it is important to understand its purpose and how it works by reviewing the included to repo README file. To effectively build a project, we usually need a team that can work collaboratively and productively. This is where branching comes in handy — it allows multiple team members to work on different features or fixes without interfering with each other’s code. So, let’s take a closer look at these aspects.
