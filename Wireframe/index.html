        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a key document that introduces and explains a
          software project. It provides an overview of what the project does,
          how to install and use it, and what technologies or dependencies it
          requires. For collaborative projects, it may also include contribution
          guidelines, licensing information, and credits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It helps new users and developers quickly understand the purpose and
          structure of the project, making it easier to get started or
          contribute. It's often the first point of reference, serving as both a
          user manual and a guide for anyone interacting with the codebase.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic visual guide used to plan the layout and
          structure of a web page or application. It outlines the placement of
          elements like headers, images, buttons, and menus without focusing on
          design details such as colors or graphics.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main purpose of a wireframe is to help developers and designers
          organize content, define functionality, and ensure a clear user flow
          before development begins.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wireframes are useful for identifying potential issues early and
          encouraging collaboration between team members and clients. They serve
          as a blueprint to guide the design and development process
          effectively.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate version of the codebase that allows
          developers to work on changes independently from the main project.
          It's commonly used to develop new features, fix bugs, or test ideas
          without affecting the main branch, often called main or master.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When a branch is created, it copies the current state of the code, and
          changes made in that branch do not affect others until they are
          merged.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Branching makes it easier for teams to collaborate and manage
          different parts of a project in parallel, helping avoid conflicts and
          maintain a clean development workflow.
