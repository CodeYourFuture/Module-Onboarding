          <h2>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A WIREFRAME?</h2>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a simple visual guide that outlines the layout and structure of a webpage or app before any design or code is added.<br>It helps designers and developers focus on functionality and user flow without getting distracted by colors or styles.

          <h2>WHAT IS A BRANCH IN GIT?</h2>
          <p>
            A branch in Git is like a separate workspace where you can make changes to your code without affecting the main project.<br> It allows you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments safely.
