        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
        In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.<br>
        Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.
        When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.
        You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
