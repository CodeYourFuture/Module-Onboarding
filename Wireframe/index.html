        <h2>What is the purpose of the WireFrames</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>wireframe</strong> is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, 
          app interface, or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. 
          Product designers and UX (user experience) professionals draw up wireframes to communicate 
          how they plan to arrange and prioritize features, and how they intend for users to interact with its product or website.

        <h2>What is the purpose of the ReadME Files</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of a <strong>README file</strong> is to provide essential information
          about a projectâ€”what it does, how to use it, and how to contribute to it.
          <strong>Tom Preston-Werner</strong>, <em>co-founder of GitHub</em>, advocates for drafting the README file before 
          commencing coding. He emphasizes that this approach helps clarify the project's purpose and goals, 
          ensuring that the development process remains user-focused.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>branch in Git</strong> is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit, 
          used to work on different versions of a project independently from the main codebase.
          It lets you develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main branch.
          Branches are essential for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
          Once changes are complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch, integrating the new code.
