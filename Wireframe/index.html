      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>The primary purpose of a <code>README.md</code> file is to serve as a user guide and introduction to a project,
      particularly in software development and GitHub repositories. It provides essential information such as the
      project's purpose, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and how others can contribute. It is often the
      first document a user or developer will read when exploring a new project or codebase.</p>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is a basic, skeletal representation of a website or application's layout and structure.
        It focuses on the arrangement of content and features without detailed design elements like colors or images.
        Wireframes act as blueprints, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the user interface
        before proceeding to the visual designphase.</p>

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>In Git, a branch represents an independent line of development. It acts as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit
        process, allowing you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. Branching enables
        teams to collaborate more effectively and manage multiple development streams within the same repository.</p>
