    <h1>Wireframe</h1>
    <p class="wireframe-description">
      A wireframe is a simplified, visual representation of a website, app, or
      other digital product, focusing on structure, layout, and content
      placement rather than detailed design elements. It's essentially a
      blueprint that outlines the organization of elements, helping designers
      and stakeholders visualize the overall user experience (UX) and identify
      potential issues early in the design process.

      <h2>README File</h2>
      <p>
        A README file serves as the front page of a software project. It usually includes an overview of the project,
        setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any necessary dependencies. This file helps users and contributors
        understand what the project is about and how to interact with it effectively.

      <h2>Purpose of a Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of a wireframe is to plan and communicate the structure and functionality of a web page or
        application early in the development process. It helps teams focus on layout, navigation, and user interaction
        without getting distracted by visual design details. Wireframes allow designers, developers, and stakeholders to
        align on how content and features will be organized, making it easier to identify usability issues and make
        improvements before coding begins.

      <h2>Git Branch</h2>
      <p>
        A branch in Git allows developers to diverge from the main codebase to work on features, fixes, or experiments
        independently. This makes it easy to manage changes, collaborate without conflicts, and merge completed work
        back into the main project safely.
