        <h2>the purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file provides an overview of a project, explaining what it is, how to install and use it, 
          and any other relevant information. It's meant to help users and developers understand the purpose, setup, and usage of the project quickly.

        <h2>the purpose of a wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a simple visual guide that shows the structure and layout of a webpage or app.
           Its main purpose is to plan the design, organize content, and show how users will interact with the interface.
           Wireframes help teams communicate ideas clearly, gather early feedback, and fix problems before moving to detailed design and development.

        <h2>a branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
         A branch in Git is a separate version of a project used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main code. 
         It helps keep work organized and allows multiple people to collaborate safely. Changes from a branch can later be merged into the main project.
