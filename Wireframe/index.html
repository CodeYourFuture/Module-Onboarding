        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p class="h2-details">
          A README file is a text file that contains information about a project. It typically includes details such as the project's purpose, how to install and use it, and any other relevant information. The README file is often the first thing that users see when they visit a project's repository, so it's important to make it clear and informative.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p class="h2-details">
          A wireframe is a visual representation of a user interface. It serves as a blueprint for the design and layout of a website or application. Wireframes help designers and developers plan the structure and functionality of a project before moving on to the actual design and development phases. They are typically low-fidelity, focusing on layout and content rather than visual design.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p class="h2-details">
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. Branches are often used to isolate changes, making it easier to manage and review code before merging it back into the main branch. This helps maintain a clean and organized project history.
