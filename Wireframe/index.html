        <h2>What is the purpose of a README.md file?</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of a README file is to explain what a project is about to
          any visitors that land on your project's repository.

        <h2>Why are wireframes used in software development projects?</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframes are a visual representation of the UI that a developer
          should implement. They help developers and clients come closer to a
          shared vision of what the requirements and scope needed for project
          execution.

        <h2>What are branches?</h2>
        <p>
          Branches reduce the possibility of unstable code getting into
          production. They allow you to write experimental code for new features
          or bug fixes, without worrying about breaking your entire application.
