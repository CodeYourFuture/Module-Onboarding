      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README file informs others about the purpose, usage, and contribution 
        guidelines of your project. According to GitHub, “You can add a README 
        file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. 
        A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution 
        guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your 
        project and helps you manage contributions.”

      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a simplified visual blueprint of a website, web page, 
        or mobile app. It shows what users will see and interact with, ensuring 
        a user-focused design and clarifying functionality.

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>
        In Git, a branch is an independent line of development used to create 
        features or fixes without altering the main codebase. It supports parallel 
        work, enabling easier collaboration and code management.
