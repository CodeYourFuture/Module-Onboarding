        <h1>Learning about Git</h1>
        <p>
          Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system
          designed to help developers manage and track changes in their code. It
          allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, maintain different
          versions of the code, and ensure that changes are documented and
          reversible.

            <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
            <p>
              A README file serves as an introduction and guide to a project,
              typically found in the root directory of a codebase or repository.
              It provides essential information to help users and contributors
              understand the project and how to interact with it effectively.

            <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>

            <p>
              A wireframe is a visual blueprint or schematic representation of a
              user interface (UI) for a website, application, or software. It
              outlines the structure, layout, and hierarchy of elements on a
              page without focusing on design details like colors, images, or
              fonts.Helps designers and developers conceptualize the structure
              of a page or interface.

            <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>
              A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in a
              repository's history, allowing you to work on different versions
              of a project simultaneously. It is commonly used to develop
              features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main
              codebase.
