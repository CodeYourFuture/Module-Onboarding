        <h1> What is the purpose of a README file?</h1>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the primary introduction and guide for a project, especially in software development and open-source repositories. It provides essential information about the project, its purpose, how to get started, and other key details for users and contributors.
           Think of it as the "user manual" or "getting started" guide for a project.  </p>
