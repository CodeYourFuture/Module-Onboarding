      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README.md file is an essential component of many software projects, especially those hosted on platforms
        like GitHub. This file serves as the first point of contact for users and developers who want to understand the
        purpose, setup,
        and usage of a project.In essence, a README is a vital tool for communication and collaboration, making it
        easier for others to understand and engage with the project.

      <h3>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h3>
      <p>The primary purpose of a wireframe is to establish the basic structure and layout of a website or application
        before visual design and content are added. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the placement of elements like
        headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. Wireframes help designers,
        developers, and stakeholders visualize the user experience and identify potential issues early in the project.

      <h4>What is a branch in Git?</h4>
      <p>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a
        snapshot of your changes.
        When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to
        encapsulate your changes.</p>
