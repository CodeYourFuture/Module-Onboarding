          <h2>What is the purpose of a <span>README</span> file?</h2>
          <p>
            A README file provides essential information about a project, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contributor details.
            It serves as a guide for users and developers, helping them understand the project's purpose and how to get started.
            A well-structured README enhances user experience and encourages collaboration.

          <h2>What is the purpose of a <span>wireframe</span>?</h2>
          <p>
            Wireframes are simple diagrams that show the layout and structure of a web page, helping developers plan the UI before coding.
            They focus on the arrangement of elements, such as buttons, images, and text, without getting into design details.
            Wireframes are essential for visualizing the user experience and ensuring that all necessary components are included.

          <h2>What is a <span>branch</span> in Git?</h2>
          <p>
            Branches in Git allow developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase, making collaboration easier.
            Each branch represents an independent line of development, enabling teams to experiment and implement changes safely.
            Once a feature is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch, ensuring that the code remains organized and manageable.
