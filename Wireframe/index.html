        <h2>The purpose of README File</h2>
        <p>
          In Software Development, clear communication is very important.
           Whether you are a solo developer or part of a large team,
            effectively conveying the purpose, setup, and usage of your
             project is important. This is where the README.md file
              comes into play. In this article, we will see What is 
              README.md File and why it is so important.

        <h2>What is the wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          An essential step in the user experience (UX) design process is
           creating a wireframe. It's a graphic representation of a website,
            mobile app, or other digital interface that highlights the overall
             structure and layout of the design without going into specifics like
              colors, fonts, or images. A wireframe is a product outline that shows 
              what interface elements will be present on important pages.

        <h2>What is Git brunch</h2>
        <p>
          A Git branch represents an independent line of development from the main codebase.
           By default, Git projects start with a main branch called "master".
            When you create a new branch, you're making a parallel version that you can
             work on without impacting that main code.
It's like having alternate realities! The master branch represents the production version
 that your users see. And feature branches represent experimental states that aren't ready to go live.
