        <h2>README</h2>
        <p>
          README files are how developers explain their project to other people.
          They introduce the codebase, explain what it is for and how to use it.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          When we build applications, we usually break down pages into
          components we can build separately. Wireframes show the placement and
          organisation of components without details like fonts, colours, or
          functionality.

        <h2>Git branches</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a repository as a big, growing tree and each new idea or
          feature as a new branch. In Git, a 'branch' is like an offshoot from
          the main trunk. It's a space to nurture new growth - new code -
          independently from the rest of the tree. You can cultivate your
          branch, tweaking and pruning it until it's exactly right.
