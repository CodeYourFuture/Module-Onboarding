      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of a wireframe is to provide a basic blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or app's user interface (UI). 
        It's like a rough sketch that focuses on the layout and placement of key elements rather than visual details.

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>
        In Git, a branch is essentially a separate line of development within your project's history. 
        Think of it as a parallel path where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase
