        <h2>What is the Purpose of a README File?</h2>
        <p>A README file is a text file that provides essential information about a project.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.</li>
          <li>It's the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.</li>
          <li>The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from a bad one.</li>
          <li>Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!</li>
        </ol>
