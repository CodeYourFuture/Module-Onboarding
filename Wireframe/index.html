      <article><h2> What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README file is usually the first file a user sees when they open a project,<br>
        and acts as a guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.</p>
        
      <p>
        A README file should include:
        <ol>
          <li>What the project does.</li>
          <li>Why the project is useful.</li>
          <li>How to install and use the project.</li>
          <li>Where to find help on a project</li>
          <li>Information on who maintains and contributes to the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a simple layout of an app or website that shows the structure and key features.<br>
          It's used early in design to plan how users will interact with the page before adding visuals and content.</p>
        <p>
          The three main purposes of wireframes are: 
          <ol>
            <li>To keep the design focused on the user.</li>
            <li>To Help identify potential problems by making features and navigation clear.</li>
            <li>A low-cost way to test ideas because they are quick to create.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
