        This wep page is a brief guide on some of the terms we use in coding. I will explain in my own words what the main terms mean and how they apply to our code.

        <h2>Purpose of a README File</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a document that provides information about a project. It typically includes details such as the project's purpose, how to install and use it, and any other relevant information that users or developers might need.
          The README file is often the first thing that users see when they visit a project's repository, so it's important to make it clear and informative.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual representation of a web page or application. It serves as a blueprint for the design and layout of the page, showing where elements like text, images, and buttons will be placed.
          Wireframes are often created in the early stages of a project to help designers and developers plan the structure and functionality of the page before moving on to more detailed design work.

        <h2>Git Branch</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a project. It allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
          When a branch is created, it starts as a copy of the main branch (usually called "main" or "master"). Developers can make changes in their branch and then merge those changes back into the main branch when they're ready.
