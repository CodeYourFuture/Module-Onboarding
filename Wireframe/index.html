      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>A README file is a document that provides information about a project,
        including its purpose, how to install and use it, and any other
        relevant details. It serves as a guide for users and developers to
        understand the project.</p>

      <h2>What is a branch in GIT?</h2>
      <p>In Git a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and implement new ideas or features and
        try to fix bugs without affecting the main branch of the project.</p>
      <p>here's a link for w3school explaining common reasons for branches and giving you a couple different examples.
