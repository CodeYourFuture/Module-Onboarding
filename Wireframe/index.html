        <h2>What is a wireframe? A guide for non-designers</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual blueprint or outline of a website or application page, focusing on structure, layout, 
          and functionality rather than aesthetics. It serves as a foundation for the design, 
          helping to plan content placement, navigation, and user flow before diving into visual elements.
