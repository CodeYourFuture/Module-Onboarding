        <h2>The purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the first point of reference for anyone interacting with a project, providing essential information such as its purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Typically written in Markdown (README.md), it helps users understand what the project does, how to install dependencies, and how to contribute. It may also include licensing information, credits, and troubleshooting tips. A well-written README enhances a project's accessibility, making it easier for developers, collaborators, and even end users to navigate and understand the codebase.
