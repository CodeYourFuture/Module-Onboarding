      <p>
        A simple way to explain how a website will look and work before adding all the fancy details.

        <h2>README</h2>
        <p>
          README is a guidebook for a project. Imagine you get a new toy, and it comes with a small booklet that explains what the toy is, how to use it, and how to take care of it.
          A README file does the same for a project, it tells people what the project is about, how to use it, and any important details they need to know.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A Wireframe is like a blueprint for a website. Imagine you're drawing a plan for a house before building it. You sketch where the rooms, doors, and windows will go, but you don't add colors,
          furniture, or decorations yet. <br/> A <em>Wireframe</em> does the same for a website, it shows where pictures, buttons, and texts will go, all the while doesn't worry about making it look pretty yet.

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>
          Git is like a magic notebook for your project. It's similar to when you're drawing a picture, and every time you make a change, the notebook saves a copy of your work. If you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier
          version and fix it. <br/> <em>Git</em> does the same for your code, it keeps track of all the changes you make so you can go back if something goes wrong.
