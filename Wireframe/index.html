    <h1>An introduction to Wireframes</h1>
    <p>
      A wireframe is a simple visual guide that shows the basic structure and layout of a webpage or app. It outlines
      where key elements like buttons, images, and text will go, without focusing on design details like colors, fonts,
      or animations.
      Wireframes are typically created in the early stages of the design process to help plan the layout and user
      experience. They allow designers, developers, and stakeholders to quickly understand how content and features will
      be organized.
      Because wireframes are quick to create and easy to adjust, they are useful for identifying problems early and
      making sure everyone is on the same page before moving on to detailed design and development.

      <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README file provides essential information about a project, such as what it does, how to install and use it,
        and any dependencies or requirements.<br>
        Its purpose is to help others understand, set up, and work with the project easily.

      <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of a wireframe is to plan and communicate the layout and functionality of a webpage or app before
        design and development begin.<br>
        It helps teams visualize the user interface, organise content, and identify potential issues early in the design
        process.

      <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
      <p>
        A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on changes or new features without
        affecting the main codebase.<br>
        It helps you experiment, make updates, and collaborate safely before merging your changes back into the main
        branch (usually called main or master).
