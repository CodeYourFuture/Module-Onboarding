      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
       A wireframe is a basic visual layout that outlines the structure and elements of a digital interface, such as a website or app,
       without incorporating design details like colors or images. 
       It serves as a blueprint to plan functionality and user flow early in the design process.

        <h2>Readme</h2>
        <p>
          In short, it's usually the first thing someone reads to understand and start working with the project.
          </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain the project: Describes what the project is, why it exists, and what problem it solves.</li>
      <li>Guide installation and setup: Provides step-by-step instructions to help others install, configure, and run the project.</li>
      <li>Document usage: Shows examples of how to use the software, commands, APIs, or features.</li>
      <li>List dependencies: Mentions any libraries, tools, or frameworks required.</li>
      <li>Facilitate collaboration: Informs contributors about coding standards, contribution guidelines, and how to report issues or suggest features.</li>
      <li>Provide licensing information: States the terms under which the project can be used or modified.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
           A wireframe serves as a blueprint or skeletal outline of a design â€” typically for a website, app, or system interface. Its main purposes are:
          <ul><li>Visual structure: It lays out the placement of elements (like headers, buttons, menus) without focusing on colors, fonts, or images.</li>
          <li>Early feedback: It helps teams and clients review and approve the layout and functionality before detailed design or coding starts.</li>
          <li>Clarify user flow: It shows how users will navigate through the app or site, ensuring the experience is smooth.</li>
          <li>Save time and costs: Catching layout or usability issues early avoids expensive changes later in the development cycle.</li>
          <li>Align the team: Designers, developers, and stakeholders can all get on the same page about how things will work.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Branch</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is like a parallel version of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase (usually called main or master).
        
Here is the purpose of branches:
<ul>
<li>Isolate work: You can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the stable code.</li>
<li>Enable collaboration: Multiple people can work on different branches at the same time and later combine their work.</li>
<li>Simplify testing: Changes can be tested in a branch before merging them into the main project.</li>
<li>Track progress: Branches help organize different stages of development, like feature/login, bugfix/navbar, or release/v2.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the work on a branch is ready and tested, it can be merged back into the main branch.
