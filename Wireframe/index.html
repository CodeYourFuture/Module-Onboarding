        <h2>README.file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as a crucial documentation tool, primarily used to provide essential information about a software project, dataset, or any other file collection. It's designed to help users (both developers and end-users) understand the project's purpose, functionality, installation instructions, and how to contribute or get help.

        <h2>Purpose of wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframes are a visual guide to what a product should look like. Their main goal is to create an app or site that delivers a cohesive and well-designed experience. They are also a great way to ensure that every element in a UI has a purpose.

        <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the main project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.
