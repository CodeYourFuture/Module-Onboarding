          <h2>README Files</h2>
          <p class = "summary">
          A README file serves as the entry point and quick reference guide for anyone starting a project,
          whether it's software code, a dataset, or any other collection of files.
          Its primary purpose is to explain what the project is, why it's useful, and how to get started with it.

          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p class = "summary">
          A wireframe is a visual representation of a user interface, often used in the early stages of design.
          It serves as a blueprint for the layout and functionality of a website or application,
          helping to communicate ideas and gather feedback before development begins.

          <h2>Git</h2>
          <p class = "summary">
          Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
          It tracks changes to files, enabling collaboration and providing a history of modifications.
