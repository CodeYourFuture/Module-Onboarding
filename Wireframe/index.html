      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
        A wireframe in coding (especially web or app development) is a simple visual layout or blueprint
         that shows the basic structure of a user interface (UI) without detailed design or content.

        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>
           Provide a clear and concise description of all relevant details about data collection, processing, and analysis in a README file. This will help others interpret and reanalyze your dataset.

          README files are created for a variety of reasons:
          
          to document changes to files or file names within a folder
          to explain file naming conventions, practices, etc. "in general" for future reference
          to specifically accompany files/data being deposited in a repository
           
          It is best practice to create a README file for each dataset regardless of whether it is being deposited in a repository because the document might become necessary later.
