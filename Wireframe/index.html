        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is an essential component of many software projects, especially those 
          hosted on platforms like GitHub. This file serves as the first point of contact for users 
          and developers who want to understand the purpose, setup, and usage of a project.

          without affecting the main project.
