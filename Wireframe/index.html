            <h2> What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
            <p>A README file is usually the first file a user sees when they open a project,
              and acts as a guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.</p>
              <p><strong>A README file should include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>What the project does.</li>
                <li>Why the project is useful.</li>
                <li>How to install and use the project.</li>
                <li>Where to find help on a project.</li>
                <li>Information on who maintains and contributes to the project.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>README files are usually written in Markdown, a simple markup language that makes it easy to format text.</p>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a Wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is a simple layout of an app or website that shows the structure and key features.
          It's used early in design to plan how users will interact with the page before adding visuals and content.</p>
        <p><strong>The three main purposes of wireframes are:</strong></p> 
          <ol>
            <li>To keep the design focused on the user.</li>
            <li>Identify potential problems by making features and navigation clear.</li>
            <li>A low-cost way to test ideas because they are quick to create.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Wireframes can be created using paper and pencil, or with software like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.</p>

          <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>A branch in Git is a separate line of development in a project and is created from another branch- usually the main one. 
          Branches are a key part of Git's version control system, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project.</p>
          <p><strong>Branches are useful for:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teams working on the <strong>same</strong> project.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing</strong> changes before merging them into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Keeping the main branch stable while <strong>developing</strong> new ideas.</li>
            <li>Working on different features or <strong>bug fixes</strong> in parallel.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>When a branch is ready, it can be merged back into the main branch. This allows for easy collaboration and helps keep the project organized.</p>
