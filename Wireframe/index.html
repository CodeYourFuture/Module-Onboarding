      <h2>README.file</h2>
      <p>
        A README file serves as a crucial documentation tool, primarily used to provide essential information about a
        software project, dataset, or any other file collection. It's designed to help users (both developers and
        end-users) understand the project's purpose, functionality, installation instructions, and how to contribute or
        get help.

      <h2>Purpose of wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are a visual guide to what a product should look like. Their main goal is to create an app or site
        that delivers a cohesive and well-designed experience. They are also a great way to ensure that every element in
        a UI has a purpose.

      <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
      <p>
        In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the
        main project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.
