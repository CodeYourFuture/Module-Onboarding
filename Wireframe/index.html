              <h3> Git Branch </h3>
              <p>
                In Git, a branch is a parallel version of your repository that diverges from the main working project. It allows you to work on different tasks, features, or fixes separately from the main codebase.
                Using branches effectively helps keep your project organized and ensures that the main codebase remains stable.
