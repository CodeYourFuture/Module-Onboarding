        <h2>1. What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a crucial component of many software projects, especially those hosted on platforms like GitHub.
           It serves as the first point of contact for users and developers who want to understand the purpose, setup, and usage 
           of a project. Essentially, a README file provides a detailed description of a project, including instructions on how to install and run it

        <h2>1. What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          Purpose of Wireframe:
          Structural Planning: Wireframes aid designers in organizing and planning the structural arrangement of a digital interface. 
          They concentrate on the best ways to arrange various components on a screen in order to produce an orderly and logical framework.
          User Flow: By illustrating how users will move through the interface and access various features and content, wireframes assist 
          designers in planning the flow of user interactions.
          Communication: Wireframes are a tool for communicating with 
          stakeholders, designers, and developers. They give design ideas and concepts a unified visual language.

        <h2>1. What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central part of the tree called
           the trunk. While branches can generate and fall off, the trunk remains compact and is the only part by which we can say the
            tree is alive and standing. Similarly, a branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding a new feature or modification
             to the software and still not affecting the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another line of
              development in the project
