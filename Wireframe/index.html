        <h2>The purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.

        <h2>Purpose of a wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. Product designers and UX (user experience) professionals draw up wireframes to communicate how they plan to arrange and prioritize features, and how they intend for users to interact with its product or website.

        <h2>Branches in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch represents a particular history of development in a project - the different versions there have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we’re working on something new, we haven’t agreed with other people that our new thing is good yet, so we often don’t add our changes to the main branch straight away. Instead we make our own branch to experiment on.
