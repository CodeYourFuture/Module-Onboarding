        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframe serve as essential tools in structural planning for digital interfaces, helping designers organize and
          arrange components to create a logical framework. They illustrate user flow by mapping how users navigate through the
          interface and access features, enhancing the planning of user interactions. Additionally, wireframes facilitate
          communication among stakeholders, designers, and developers by providing a unified visual language for design ideas and
          concepts.
