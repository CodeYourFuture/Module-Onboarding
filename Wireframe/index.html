          What is the purpose of a README file?
        </h5>
        <p>
          A README file is a text file that describes and launches a project. It includes information that is needed to understand the scope of the project and it might also contain, instructions, help and details about the patches or updates. Its file format is "md", which stands for Markdown documentation. It is good practice to create a README file for every new project, as this will help the person looking at our project, to understand how to install the project, its purpose, the languages and frameworks used and how to navigate through it. It may also contain images and videos, so to help the reader with visual resources as well.

        <h2>WIREFRAME</h2>
        <h5>
          What is the purpose of a wireframe?
        </h5>
        <p>When we create a wireframe, we are building a design for our project, before starting to work on the project. The wireframe can in fact be considered a plan for our website or app: it displays the positioning of every single element, creating a framework we will follow while developing the page. Having a wireframe, helps a developer by giving clarity on the project and it is a cost-efficient practice, as it makes possible applying changes before the development begins.

        <h2>BRANCH</h2>
        <h5>
          What is a branch in Git?
        </h5>
        <p>
          A branch is a way to develop isolated work on a project, without affecting other branches in our repository. Every repository has a default branch, usually called 'main' or 'master', which enclose the main content of the project. By creating a branch, we can work on features, bugs, develop new content or modify specific elements, on a separate area of the main repository and afterwards merge this branch into the main one to apply changes or new features to the project. When merging, we refer to the main branch as 'head branch' and to the secondary branch the 'base branch'. To merge two branches, we need to create a pull request, so a request to the owner of the project main repository, to check our base branch and accept or deny the changes. It is a very useful way to work on a project, without modifying its content, until we have a final version.
