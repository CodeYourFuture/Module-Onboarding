        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframes are a visual guide to what a product should look like.
          Their main goal is to create an app or site that delivers a cohesive
          and well-designed experience. They are also a great way to ensure that
          every element in a UI has a purpose.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>

          an introduction to the project. It explains the purpose of the project
          and provides instructions on how to use the software.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of
          these commits. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start
          making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last
          commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer
          moves forward automatically.
