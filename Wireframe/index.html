        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a file you can add to your GitHub repository (repo) to 
          inform people interested in your project about its usefulness, how it 
          can be used and what they can do with it. According to GitHub “You can 
          add a README file to a repository to communicate important information 
          about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation 
          file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates 
          expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.”

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a simplified visual blueprint of a website, web page, 
          or mobile app, illustrating what users will see and interact with upon arrival. 
          It outlines the application's functionality, ensuring a user-centric design 
          while clarifying features and navigation. Additionally, wireframes are quick 
          and cost-effective to create, making them an essential tool in the early 
          stages of development.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch serves as an independent development path, allowing you to 
          work on new features or fixes without modifying the main codebase. 
          It supports parallel workflows, making it more efficient to track changes 
          and collaborate with others
