      <h1>What is a Wireframe</h1>
      <p id="wireframe-definition">
        A <strong>wireframe</strong> is a visual representation of a user interface,
        often used in the early stages of design to outline the structure and layout of a website or application.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>wireframe</strong> serves as a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application.
          The primary purpose of a <strong>wireframe</strong> is to establish the basic structure and layout of a website 
          or application before visual design and content are added.
        </p>
        <p>
          It acts as a blueprint, outlining the placement of elements like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. 
          Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the user experience and identify potential issues early in the project.

        <h2>What is the README File?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>README</strong> file is a text file that contains information about a project. 
          It is typically included in the root directory of a project and is often the first file that users see when they access the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          A README provides users with essential information about the project, its purpose, how to use it, and where to find help or support.
          It's a crucial tool for communication and documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-structured <strong>README</strong> file helps users understand the project quickly and effectively.
        </p>
        <p>A typical README file might include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project Overview</li>
          <li>Installation Instructions</li>
          <li>Usage Examples</li>
          <li>Contribution Guidelines</li>
          <li>Troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Changelog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>README</strong> files are often written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>branch</strong> in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository's history. 
          When you create a new branch, you're essentially creating a new line of development that diverges from the main line (usually the master branch).
        </p>
        <p>
          A branch in <strong>Git</strong> is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. 
          The default branch name in Git is <strong>master</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. 
          Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
