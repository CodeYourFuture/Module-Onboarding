      <p>
      A wireframe is a visual representation of a webpage, app, or software interface. It is a critical tool in
      the design process that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a product before detailed design and
      development begin.

          <summary>Definition of a Branch</summary>
          <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate workspace for your project that allows you to isolate your work, such as
          developing a new feature or fixing a bug, from the main version of your project (often referred to as the main or master
          branch).
