        <h2>Purpose of Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a wireframe is to outline the basic structural design and user experience of a website or application before any detailed design work is done. It's a visual representation of the layout, content, and functionality, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the overall structure and flow.
