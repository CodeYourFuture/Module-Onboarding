          <h2>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A WIREFRAME?</h2>
          <p>

          <h2>WHAT IS A BRANCH IN GIT?</h2>
          <p>
            A branch in Git is like a separate workspace where you can make changes to your code without affecting the main project.<br> It allows you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments safely.
