        <h2>Stuffed Cabbage without the Stuffing</h2>
        <p>Stuffed cabbage is historically a slow-braised dish, but this recipe speeds things up a bit by, well, skipping the stuffing. Cutting the cabbage into pieces and cooking the ground meat directly against the heat of the pan or pot helps to cut down on time.</p>

        <h2>Grilled Chicken with Molasses and Rum Barbecue Sauce</h2>
        <p>
          This recipe sneaks in some Caribbean flavors, evoking a beach-time feeling. 
          The key is making sure the grill is at the right temperature. Heat it to medium, place the chicken skin-side down and slowly cook so the fat renders and the skin gets crispy, without touching.
          Make the barbecue sauce in advance. It can be stored in an airtight container for a few days, then reheat when ready to serve.

        <h2>Legendary Smash Burger</h2>
        <p>
          This delicious recipe is inspired by the Hard Rock Cafe's Legendary Smash Burger â€” named that for good reason. The perfectly charred patties are topped with bacon onion jam, crisp pickles and signature Legendary Sauce.
