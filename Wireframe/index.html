      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
       A wireframe is a basic visual layout that outlines the structure and elements of a digital interface, such as a website or app,
       without incorporating design details like colors or images. 
       It serves as a blueprint to plan functionality and user flow early in the design process.

        <h2>Readme</h2>

        <p>In short, it's usually the first thing someone reads to understand and start working with the project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Explain the project:</strong> Describes what the project is, why it exists, and what problem it solves.</li>
          <li><strong>Guide installation and setup:</strong> Provides step-by-step instructions to help others install, configure, and run the project.</li>
          <li><strong>Document usage:</strong> Shows examples of how to use the software, commands, APIs, or features.</li>
          <li><strong>List dependencies:</strong> Mentions any libraries, tools, or frameworks required.</li>
          <li><strong>Facilitate collaboration:</strong> Informs contributors about coding standards, contribution guidelines, and how to report issues or suggest features.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide licensing information:</strong> States the terms under which the project can be used or modified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
           A wireframe serves as a blueprint or skeletal outline of a design, typically for a website, app, or system interface. Its main purposes are:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visual structure:</strong> It lays out the placement of elements (like headers, buttons, menus) without focusing on colors, fonts, or images.</li>
          <li><strong>Early feedback:</strong> It helps teams and clients review and approve the layout and functionality before detailed design or coding starts.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarify user flow:</strong> It shows how users will navigate through the app or site, ensuring the experience is smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>Save time and costs:</strong> Catching layout or usability issues early avoids expensive changes later in the development cycle.</li>
          <li><strong>Align the team:</strong> Designers, developers, and stakeholders can all get on the same page about how things will work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Branch</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is like a parallel version of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase (usually called main or master).
        
        <p>Here is the purpose of branches:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Isolate work:</strong> You can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the stable code.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable collaboration:</strong> Multiple people can work on different branches at the same time and later combine their work.</li>
          <li><strong>Simplify testing:</strong> Changes can be tested in a branch before merging them into the main project.</li>
          <li><strong>Track progress:</strong> Branches help organize different stages of development, like feature/login, bugfix/navbar, or release/v2.0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the work on a branch is ready and tested, it can be merged back into the main branch.</p>
