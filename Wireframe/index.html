      <h1>**Key Concepts in Software Development: README, Wireframes, and Git Branches**</h1>
      <p>
        This article explains three fundamental concepts in software development: the purpose of a README file for project documentation, the role of wireframes in UI/UX design, and the function of branches in Git for managing code versions and collaboration.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a low-fidelity visual representation of a webpage or app layout. It outlines structure, navigation, and content placement without detailed design elements. Wireframes help designers and stakeholders plan functionality, user experience, and flow, ensuring alignment before development begins, and serving as a blueprint for the final product.

        <h3>What is the purpose of a README file?</h3>
        <p>
          A README file provides essential information about a project, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and how to contribute. It helps users and developers understand the project quickly, ensuring smooth setup and interaction. It's crucial for collaboration, maintenance, and offering support or contact information

        <h4>What is a branch in Git?</h4>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. Changes in a branch can be merged back into the main branch once they're tested and ready for release.
