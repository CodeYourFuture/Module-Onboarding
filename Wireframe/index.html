      <h1>What is a Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
A <strong> wireframe</strong> is a basic, visual blueprint or layout of a website, app, or digital product, focused on structure, 
functionality, and content placement without detailed design elements like colors or images. 
It's essentially a sketch or outline that helps designers and stakeholders visualize the core elements and 
user experience before diving into detailed design and development.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a wireframe is to establish the basic structure and layout of a website 
          or application before visual design and content are added. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the 
          placement of elements like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and navigation. Wireframes help designers, developers, 
          and stakeholders visualize the user experience and identify potential issues early in the project.

        <h2>What is the README File?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>README</strong> file serves as an introductory document for a project, 
          providing users with essential information about the project, 
          its purpose, how to use it, and where to find help or support. 
          It's often the first thing someone will see when they access a 
          project, making it a crucial tool for communication and documentation

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. 
          The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're 
          given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, 
          the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. Note.
