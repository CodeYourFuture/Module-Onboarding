        <h2>What is GitHub README file</h2>

          GitHub repositories often contain a special file called <em>README.md</em>, which serves as the first point of interaction for developers, users, and contributors.<br> The <strong>README</strong> file provides an overview of the project, installation steps, usage guidelines, and other essential information.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of a README file</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provides an overview of the project</li>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframing is the process of creating a design for your project before actually working on your project.<br> It involves designers developing a simplified blueprint or rough plan for websites, apps, or other digital entities. <br>These plans will help you with the placement of buttons, menus, and other vital elements without focusing on making your project beautiful at this stage.
          Wireframing means creating a simplified design for your project, which only includes the components that you want to see in your project. <br> It doesn't involve any complicated design. <br>The main goal of creating a wireframe for your project is to give you an idea of how your project should look like. You can add buttons, a navigation bar, text boxes, images, or any other useful components that you want to see in your project design.       
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clarity and Communication:</strong> Wireframes give you clarity about how your project will look, it help you in visualizing the layout and functionality.<br>This will also help you to have clear communication with the team members, clients, and developers.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> When you create a simple design for your project, it becomes easier to make changes before starting the actual work. <br>This will save you time and also prevent expensive rework.</li>
          <li>Documents usage instructions</li>
          <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Wireframes usually focus on user experience as it helps to create layout, navigation, and content placement. <br>This user-centered approach helps in creating interfaces that are user-friendly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a Git Branch?</h2>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the main project.<br>Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.
          Branches let you work on different parts of a project, like new <em>features or bug fixes</em>, without interfering with the main branch.     
        </p>
        <h2>Why Use Branches?</h2>
        <p>Branches let you work on different parts of a project, like new features or bug fixes, without interfering with the main branch.</p>
        <h2>Common Reasons to Create a Branch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a new feature</li>
          <li>Fixing a bug</li>
          <li>Documents usage instructions</li>
          <li>Experimenting with ideas</li>
        </ul>
