          <b>README</b> are text files intended to provide an introduction and 
          essential description of a project. The aim is to inform the project's audience
          on how to install it and use it, including possibly collaborating.
          <br> It is good practice to create the README file when first starting a project and
          locate it in the top level directory.

        <h2>Branch in Git</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>branch</summary>
          <p>Sequence of commits in a project.</p>
        </details>
        <p>
          In Git, branches originate from a given workspace and allow the developer
          to introduce changes without affecting the main project. As such, multiple
          branches can be conviniently created, each focusing on a different feature. 
          Once a branch is completed, it can also be merged with the main project.
