      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a low-fidelity, two-dimensional blueprint of a webpage or
         application interface.</p>

         <p>It outlines the basic structure, layout, and 
         functionality without delving into design specifics like colors, 
         typography, or images.

        <h2>What is the purpose of README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as the front page or user guide for a projectâ€”typically found in software repositories.<br>
           Its main purpose is to explain the project to others, making it easier for users and collaborators to<br>
            understand, use, or contribute to it.
