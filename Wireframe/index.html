        <h2>README files</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a document that gives an overview of a project and often serves as a guide for developers and users to understand the project quickly. It often provides a detailed description of the project such as its purpose, features, and how to use it.

        <h2>Branches In Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features independently of the main codebase of the project. In the separate branch the changes are checked and accepted before they can be merged into the main codebase.
