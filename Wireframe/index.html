        <h2>What Is A README File?</h2>
        <p>
         A README file provides important information about a project, such as its purpose, installation instructions, and usage details.
         It helps users quickly understand how to set up and use the project, and provides developers with guidelines for contributing, troubleshooting, or making changes.
          Including a README file on your repository is totally essential.

          <h2>What Is The Purpose Of A Wireframe?</h2>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a simple visual guide that outlines the layout and structure of a webpage or app before any design or code is added.
            It helps designers and developers focus on functionality and user flow without getting distracted by colors or styles.

          <h2>What Is A Branch In Git?</h2>
          <p>
            A branch in Git is like a separate workspace where you can make changes to your code without affecting the main project.<br> It allows you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments safely.
