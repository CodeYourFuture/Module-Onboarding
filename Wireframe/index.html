      <article><h2> What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
      <p>
        A README file is usually the first file a user sees when they open a project,<br>
        and acts as a guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.</p>

      <p>
        A README file should include:
        <ul>
          <li>What the project does.</li>
          <li>Why the project is useful.</li>
          <li>How to install and use the project.</li>
          <li>Where to find help on a project</li>
          <li>Information on who maintains and contributes to the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a simple layout of an app or website that shows the structure and key features.
          It's used early in design to plan how users will interact with the page before adding visuals and content.</p>
        <p>
          The three main purposes of wireframes are: 
          <ol>
            <li>To keep the design focused on the user.</li>
            <li>To Help identify potential problems by making features and navigation clear.</li>
            <li>A low-cost way to test ideas because they are quick to create.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wireframes can be created using paper and pencil, or with software like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.</p>

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development in a project.<br>
          Itâ€™s created from another branch, usually the main one, so you can make changes without affecting the rest of the project.
          Each branch is like a copy of the project where you can work on different versions of a project at the same time.</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Branches are useful for teams working on the same project.</li>
            <li>You can create a new branch for features, bug fixes, or experiments, and then merge them back into the main branch when they're ready.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
