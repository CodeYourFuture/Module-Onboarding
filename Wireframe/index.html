            <p>

                <h2>Wireframe</h2>
                <p>
                    A wireframe is a simple visual layout that outlines the structure and functionality of a website or app. It is used by developers before starting the project design and development stage. Wireframes can be seen as addressing fuctionallity rather than design details.

                <h2>Git Branch</h2>
                <p>
                    A Git branch is a separate version of a project that allows developers to work on a code independently from the main repository. Changes suggested and made are merged with the main repository after developers have agreed to do so.
