        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.</br>
           Once the changes are ready, branches can be merged back into the main codebase, keeping the project organized and flexible.
