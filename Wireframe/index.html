        This is a webpage explaining what is the purpose of a README file, what is the purpose of a wireframe,
        and what is a branch in Git.<br>
        There will be three articles below for that purpose.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as an essential introduction to a software project, helping users and developers understand what the project does, 
          how to install and use it, and how to contribute. 
          Typically written in plain text or Markdown, the README outlines the projectâ€™s purpose, prerequisites, setup instructions, usage examples, and licensing details.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual blueprint used in web design to outline the basic structure 
          and layout of a webpage or app interface before any visual design or content is added.
          It help designers, developers, and stakeholders communicate ideas clearly, align expectations, 
          and identify usability issues early in the design process.

        <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit, 
          allowing developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments independently of the main codebase. 
          It enables multiple versions of a project to exist simultaneously without interfering with each other.
