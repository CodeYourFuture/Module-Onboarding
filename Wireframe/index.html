          Wireframes are typically created to outline the fundamental structure, layout, and functionality of the user interface without getting into the specifics of colors, graphics, or detailed content. Wireframes are a simplified, visual representation of a digital interface, such as a website, mobile app, or software application.
          Purpose of Wireframe: 
          1/Structural Planning.
          2/User Flow.
          3/Communication.
