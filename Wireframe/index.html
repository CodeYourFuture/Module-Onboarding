        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file serves as a crucial piece of documentation for any software project, providing essential information to users, developers, and contributors. It typically outlines what the project does, why it's useful, how to get started, and where to seek help. Essentially, it acts as a welcome guide, making it easier for anyone to understand and interact with the project.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a wireframe is to outline the basic structural design and user experience of a website or application before any detailed design work is done. It's a visual representation of the layout, content, and functionality, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the overall structure and flow.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
