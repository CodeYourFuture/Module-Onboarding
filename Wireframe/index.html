      <h1>Wireframe</h1>
      <p> it's a graphic representation of a website, 
        mobile app or other digital interface that highlights the overall structure and 
        layout of the design without going into specifics like colors, fonts or images.</p>

        <h2>What is the purpose of README.md file? </h2>
        <p>
         A README.md file provides essential information about a project, 
         including its purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, 
         contribution details, licensing and contact information, 
         helping users and developers understanding and engage with the project effectively.

          <h3> What is the purpose of wireframe?</h3>
          <p>
            A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality
            on on a page which it takes into account user needs and user journeys. 
            Wireframe is used early in the development process to establish 
            the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

      <h4> What is a Branch in Git? </h4>
    <p> 
    Git Branches allow us to work on different versions of our code simultaneously. 
    Think of branches as alternative timelines. 
    Git Branches allow us to create separate contexts where we can try new things or 
    even work on multiple ideas in parallel without risking the codebase.
