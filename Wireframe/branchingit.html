        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is essentially a pointer to a specific commit within a repository. It allows you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously, without interfering with the main or other branches of development.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Key Points About Git Branches:</h4>
          <h3>1. Parallel Development:</h3>
          <p>A branch lets you work on new features, fixes, or experiments in isolation. This way, your changes don’t affect the main codebase (often called the main or master branch) until you're ready to merge them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>You might create a branch to work on a new feature, like a "login" feature, and once it's done and tested, you can merge it back into the main branch.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>2. Default Branch:</h3>
          <p>The default branch in a Git repository is usually called main (formerly master). This is the primary branch where stable, production-ready code lives. New branches are often created from main.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>3. Creating a Branch:</h3>
          <p>You can create a new branch in Git using the command:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git branch "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p>This creates the branch but does not switch to it. To switch to the new branch, you'd run:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git checkout "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p>Or you can combine these into a single step using:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git checkout -b "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>4. Branching Workflow:</h3>
          <p>Git allows you to create, delete, and merge branches easily. A common workflow looks like this:
          </p>
          <li>You create a new branch from main to work on a specific task.</li>
          <li>As you make changes, you commit them to the branch.</li>
          <li>Once the work is done and tested, you can merge the branch back into main.</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Merging</strong> is the process of integrating the changes from one branch into another (usually from a feature branch into main).
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>5. Isolation:</h3>
          <p>Since each branch is separate, you can make changes in one branch without affecting others. This makes it easier to manage multiple features or bug fixes at the same time, or to try something new without risking the main codebase.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>6. Collaboration:</h3>
          <p>Branches make collaboration easier. Different team members can work on different branches, and later merge their work together. This prevents conflicts from happening in the main branch, allowing developers to integrate their work smoothly.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>One developer might work on a feature-authentication branch, while another works on feature-payment. Both can work independently, and later they can merge their branches into the main branch without interfering with each other’s work.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>7. Common Git Branch Commands:</h3>
          <p>List all branches:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git branch</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p>Switch to another branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git checkout "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p>Merge a branch into the current branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git merge "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p>Delete a branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git branch -d "branch-name"</strong></span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>8. Benefits of Using Branches:</h3>
          <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can experiment without worrying about breaking the main codebase.</li>
          <li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Different developers can work on different features simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Organized Workflow:</strong> Branches help organize work around specific tasks, such as bug fixes, features, or experiments.</li>
          <br>
          <h5>Example Workflow:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Start with the main branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git checkout main</strong></span></li>
            <li>Create and switch to a new branch for a feature:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git checkout -b feature-xyz</strong></span></li>
            <li>Make changes and commit them in the new branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git add .<br>git commit -m "Added feature XYZ"</strong></span></li>
            <li>Switch back to main and merge the feature branch:<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git merge feature-xyz</strong></span></li>
            <li>Delete the feature branch (optional, once the merge is complete):<br><span style="font-weight: 100; font-style: italic; color: gray;"><strong>git branch -d feature-xyz</strong></span></li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>In summary, branches in Git allow you to work on isolated pieces of a project without affecting other work, making it easier to collaborate and manage different development tasks.</p>
