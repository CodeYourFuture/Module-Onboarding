/* ====== Design Palette ======
 This is our "design palette".
 It sets out the colours, fonts, styles etc to be used in this design 
 At work, a designer will give these to you based on the corporate brand, but while you are learning
 You can design it yourself if you like
 Inspect the starter design with Devtools
 Click on the colour swatches to see what is happening
 I've put some useful CSS you won't have learned yet
 For you to explore and play with if you are interested
