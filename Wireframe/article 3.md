A git branch is a separate version of a project and it allows changes to be made independently from the main repository. It allows diffrent developers to work on a project simultaneously without affecting the main code. The changes that are made in branches can be merged with the main code after developers have an agreement on which changes work better. The key features of a branch are:
1. Isolation-allows a developer to isolate their work before making final changes
2. Parallel development-developers can code and sugggest changes simultaneously.
3. Merging-with the main brach or other branch
