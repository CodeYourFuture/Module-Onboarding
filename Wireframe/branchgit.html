        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
          <p>In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the main project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.</p>
        <h3>Why use branches?</h2>

        <ol>
       
        <li>Branches let you work on different parts of a project, like new features or bug fixes, without interfering with the main branch. </li>
        
        <li>It allows to have experiments in isolation without interfering with the main codebase. Each branch represents a separate line of development, enabling parallel work on different features simultaneously.</li>
        
        <li>A well-defined branching strategy helps maintain code quality. </li>
        </ol>
