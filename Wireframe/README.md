# Wireframe

![Wireframe](./wireframe.png)

Using the provided wireframe and resources, write a new webpage explaining:

* What is the purpose of a README file?

        A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. 
        It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.
* What is the purpose of a wireframe?

          A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project. 
          Think of it as the foundation for your website, app, or dashboard.
           It focuses on layout, and content placementâ€”not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.
 * What is a branch in Git?
In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and 
          try new ideas without affecting the main project. 
          Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.

There are some provided HTML and CSS files you can use to get started. You can use these files as a starting point or create your own files from scratch. You _must_ modify the HTML and CSS files to meet the acceptance criteria and you must check this criteria yourself before you submit your work.
