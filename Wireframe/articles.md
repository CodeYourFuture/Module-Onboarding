What is the purpose of a wireframe?

The purpose of a wireframe is to provide a simplified, visual representation of a webpage, app, or digital product's layout and structure before detailed design elements (like colors, fonts, and graphics) are added.

Key Purposes of a Wireframe:
  1.Clarify Structure & Layout – Shows the placement of key elements (headers, buttons, images, text blocks).

  2.Focus on Functionality – Helps prioritize usability and user flow without visual distractions.

  3.Early Feedback & Collaboration – Allows stakeholders (designers, developers, clients) to review and refine the 
  concept early.

  4.Cost & Time Efficiency – Identifies potential issues before high-fidelity designs or development begin.

  5.Blueprint for Development – Serves as a guide for designers and developers to build the final product.

What is a branch in Git?

In Git, a branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit in your repository's history. Branches allow you to work on different versions of your code simultaneously without affecting the main codebase (usually the main or master branch).
