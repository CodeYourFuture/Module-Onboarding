1. What is the purpose of a README file?

Its purpose is to tell other people information about why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

A README file serves as the backbone of any software project, offering clear documentation for developers, users, and contributors. It provides essential details such as installation instructions, project structure, and usage guidelines, ensuring accessibility and ease of navigation. Whether you're working on an open-source project or private development, a well-crafted README enhances collaboration and reduces confusion. Beyond technical guidance, a README file establishes credibility and professionalism. It acts as a first impression, helping users quickly grasp the project's intent and functionality. By maintaining an informative and concise README, developers foster engagement, encourage contributions, and create a seamless onboarding experience.

2. What is the purpose of a wireframe?

Its purpose is to create a schematic in the early stages of digital product design to help visualize and communicate the structure of a website or different products.

A wireframe is a foundational visual guide used in web and app design to outline structure, functionality, and user flow. It serves as a blueprint, allowing designers and developers to plan layouts without distractions from colors or detailed visuals. By focusing on hierarchy and navigation, wireframes ensure a smooth user experience and efficient interaction with the interface. Beyond aesthetics, wireframes facilitate collaboration, aligning stakeholders and teams on project goals. They highlight key features, prevent design inconsistencies, and streamline development. With a clear wireframe, teams can refine ideas early, saving time and resources while ensuring a well-structured final product.

3. What is a branch in Git?

In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that allows multiple contributors to work on different features simultaneously. It provides a safe space to experiment, make changes, and refine code without affecting the main project. By using branches, developers can isolate updates, test new ideas, and merge them seamlessly when ready. Branches enable collaboration and enhance project organization. Teams can create feature branches for new functionalities, bug fixes, or updates, ensuring a clean and structured workflow. With Git's branching system, version control becomes more streamlined, reducing conflicts and improving efficiency in software development.
