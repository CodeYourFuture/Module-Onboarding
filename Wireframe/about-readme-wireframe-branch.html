          <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
          <p>
            A README file provides essential information about a project,
            including its purpose, instructions, and usage guidelines. It serves
            as a first point of reference for users and contributors, ensuring
            clear communication and collaboration.

          <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a visual blueprint of a webpage. It outlines the
            structure and layout of elements, helping designers and developers
            align on the design before development begins. Wireframes streamline
            the process and reduce costly revisions.

          <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>
            A branch in Git is an independent line of development within a
            repository. It allows developers to work on features or fixes in
            isolation, ensuring the stability of the main branch. Once complete,
            changes can be merged back into the main branch with a pull request.
