  <h1>Purpose of the Wireframe</h1>

        <h2>What is Wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project. Think of it as the foundation for your website, app, or
          dashboard. It focuses on layout, and content placement—not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.</p>
        <h3>Benefits Of The Wireframe</h3>


        <ol>

          <li>Clarify structure: They help you pinpoint what major components—like headers, navigation, and content
            areas
            should be included. This clarification can ease anxiety over the “big picture” of your site, app, or
            dashboard. </li>

          <li>Communicate ideas: Wireframes serve as a simple language to share early concepts with teammates,
            stakeholders, or clients. It’s much easier to discuss functionality and flow when you’re not distracted by
            design details like colors and fonts.</li>

          <li>Improved feedback: When there’s something tangible to look at, it becomes easier for key stakeholders to
            provide meaningful feedback. They have something to comment on, rather than vague ideas to comment about.
            Best
            of all…wireframes take care of those impossibly long page requirements. </li>

          <li>Save time and money: By identifying problems early, wireframes prevent costly revisions and code
            rewritings.
            They’re quick to create and modify—making sure you don’t invest too much into details before the idea is
            fully
            baked. </li>

          <li>Faster path to launch: Wireframes help you confirm ideas before you commit to building. Instead of
            spending
            weeks developing something that might miss the mark, you can sketch it out, share it, and quickly iterate.
