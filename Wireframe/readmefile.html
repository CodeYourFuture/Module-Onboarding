        <h2>Best practices for it</h2>
          
        <p>It is a text document which provides a clear and concise description of all relevant details about data collection, processing, analysis, and naming convention.</p>
        
        <p>It should be easy to write and easy to read in order to be understandable by yourself and others in the future.  </p>

        <li>Creating a README file at the beginning of your research process, and updating it consistently throughout your research, will help you to compile a final README file when your data is ready for deposit. </li>
        
        <li>Write your README file as a plain text file and avoid proprietary formats whenever possible. However, PDF is acceptable when formatting is important. </li>
        
        <li>Follow the scientific conventions for your discipline. </li>
        
        <li>Store a README file with each distinct dataset that explains your file naming convention along with any abbreviations or codes you have used and any other necessary documentation. </li>
       
        <li>Locate the README file at the root of the project rather than in a sub-folder </li>
        
        <li>Use blank lines or dashes to separate the document into paragraphs, and use bullet points or ordered lists instead of long paragraphs </li>
        
        <li>Paragraphs order and title sections are not fixed, simply make it understandable </li>
